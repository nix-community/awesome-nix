# Contributing Guidelines

Make sure your pull request follows these guidelines:

- Search through the previous pull requests before making a new one! 🙏
- Make sure you've personally used or benefited from the suggested resource.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use the following format: `[Resource Title](url) — description.`
- Expand on why the resource is useful in your pull request if needed.
- Keep descriptions short and simple.
- Add new categories or improve existing categories if possible -- it's welcome!
- Double check your spelling and grammar! 😁
- Keep entries sorted alphabetically by title.

See also the upstream Awesome project's [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/main/contributing.md) and [manifesto/requirements](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/main/awesome.md). Some of the more basic entry formatting requirements are checked via a [awesome-lint](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-lint) GitHub Action; run it locally first if you can!

Thanks for contributing!
